"""
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the
array is monotonic. An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing. Non-increasing elements aren't necessarily
exculisvely decreasing; they simply don't increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements aren't
necessarily exclusively increasing; they simply don't decrease.

NOTE: empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.
